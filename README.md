Our story started with the idea of giving used coffee grounds a new lease of life. We’ve now transformed more than 450 tonnes of the stuff into our sustainable skincare.

But why stop there? Our palm oil-free soaps are made with residual chai spices left over after making chai syrups. Nothing is safe from being  – only our imagination can limit us! Next up, we’re saving flower petals from florists and wedding venues.
